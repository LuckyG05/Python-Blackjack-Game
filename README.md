## Project Overview

This is a console-based **Blackjack card game** built using Python. It allows a single player to play against an AI dealer, adhering to the basic rules of Blackjack (also known as 21). The game is designed with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to ensure a clear, modular, and extensible codebase.

## Features

* **Player vs. Dealer:** Engage in a classic 1-on-1 match against the computer dealer.
* **Dynamic Card Management:** Cards are dealt from a shuffled deck, ensuring random gameplay.
* **Intelligent Hand Value Calculation:** Automatically calculates hand totals, with **Ace flexibility** (value adjusts between 1 and 11 to prevent busting).
* **Hit & Stand Mechanics:** Players can choose to "Hit" (take another card) or "Stand" (end their turn).
* **Dealer AI:** The dealer automatically hits until their hand value is 17 or higher.
* **Win/Loss/Tie Conditions:** Clearly determines and announces winners based on standard Blackjack rules (Blackjack, Busts, Higher Score).
* **Multiple Game Rounds:** Play as many games as you like in a single session.
